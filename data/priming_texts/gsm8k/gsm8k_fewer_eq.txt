# To run his grocery store, Mr. Haj needs $4000 a day. This money is used to pay for orders done, delivery costs and employees' salaries.

# After complaints from the residents of Tatoosh about the number of cats on the island, the wildlife service carried out a relocation mission that saw the number of cats on the island drastically reduced. On the first relocation mission, 600 cats were relocated from the island to a neighboring island. On the second mission, half of the remaining cats were relocated to a rescue center inland. If the number of cats originally on the island was 1800, write a program that prints how many cats remained on the island after the rescue mission?

# A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, write a program that prints what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?
