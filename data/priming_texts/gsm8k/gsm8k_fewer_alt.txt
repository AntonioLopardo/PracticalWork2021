# Write a program that prints the answer to the following question. To run his grocery store, Mr. Haj needs $4000 a day. This money is used to pay for orders done, delivery costs and employees' salaries. If he spends 2/5 of the total operation costs on employees' salary and 1/4 of the remaining amount on delivery costs, how much money he pays for the orders done?
total_cost_per_day = 4000
employees_cost = total_cost_per_day * 2 / 5
delivery_costs = (total_cost_per_day - employees_cost) * 1 / 4
orders_costs = total_cost_per_day - delivery_costs - employees_cost

# Write a program that prints the answer to the following question. In a stationery store, there are three kinds of pencils. A pencil with an eraser, which costs $0.8 each, a regular pencil for $0.5 each, and a short pencil for $0.4 each. This store was able to sell 200 pencils with an eraser, 40 regular pencils, and 35 short pencils. How much money did the store make from these sales?
pencils_eraser_cost = 0.8
pencils_regular_cost = 0.5
pencils_short_cost = 0.4
nr_pencil_eraser = 200
nr_pencil_regular = 40
nr_pencil_short = 35
total_pencils_cost = (
    nr_pencil_eraser * pencils_eraser_cost
    + nr_pencil_regular * pencils_regular_cost
    + nr_pencil_short * pencils_short_cost
)

# Write a program that prints the answer to the following question. After complaints from the residents of Tatoosh about the number of cats on the island, the wildlife service carried out a relocation mission that saw the number of cats on the island drastically reduced. On the first relocation mission, 600 cats were relocated from the island to a neighboring island. On the second mission, half of the remaining cats were relocated to a rescue center inland. If the number of cats originally on the island was 1800, how many cats remained on the island after the rescue mission?
total_cats_on_island = 1800
nr_cats_relocated_first_mission = 600
nr_cats_relocated_second_mission = (
    total_cats_on_island - nr_cats_relocated_first_mission
) / 2
nr_cats_left = (
    total_cats_on_island
    - nr_cats_relocated_first_mission
    - nr_cats_relocated_second_mission
)

# Write a program that prints the answer to the following question. Mr. Rainwater has some goats, 9 cows and some chickens. He has 4 times as many goats as cows and 2 times as many goats as chickens. How many chickens does he have?
goats_cows_ratio = 4 / 1
goats_chickens_ratio = 2 / 1
nr_cows = 9
nr_goats = 9 * goats_cows_ratio
nr_chickens = nr_goats / goats_chickens_ratio

# Write a program that prints the answer to the following question. A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?
rent_first_apartment = 800
utilities_first_apartment = 260
rent_second_apartment = 900
utilities_second_apartment = 200
distance_to_work_first_apartment = 31
distance_to_work_second_apartment = 21
cost_per_mile = 0.58
work_days = 20
cost_first_apartment = (
    rent_first_apartment
    + utilities_first_apartment
    + (cost_per_mile * distance_to_work_first_apartment * work_days)
)
cost_second_apartment = (
    rent_second_apartment
    + utilities_second_apartment
    + (cost_per_mile * distance_to_work_second_apartment * work_days)
